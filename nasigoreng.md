- Stir in and fry the cabbage/leeks and nasi goreng spices.
- Add the rice and chopped pork.
- Stir in the cumin, coriander (and any other spices).
- Warm the mixture, but do not let the rice get hard. It should stay light yellow.
- Add the shrimps in the last 10 minutes.
- Fry the kroepoek.
- Fry a thin, plain omelette.
- Garnish with the onion and strips of omelette.
- Serve with cucumber and kroepoek on the side.

## Note

Since the Nasi Goreng is tastier the second time round, one can prepare most of it the day before. Then only the omelette and kroepoek need to be made up at the time of the meal.
