# Oven Fries

Garlic burns. Try to put in oven during last ten minutes. 

## Ingredients

- 4 large baking (starchy) potatoes
- olive oil
- salt
- optional: dill weed, garlic powder ...

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 190° C 
- Chop potatoes into chips (2-2.5 cm wedges). (Leave skin on.)
- Soak for 30 minutes in cold water.
- Dry well (salad spinner + tea towel).
- Toss potatoes with olive oil and salt, rosemary and garlic
- Place on baking sheet or in a casserole 
- Cook first at 190° for 20', then increase to 230° for another 20', until golden brown

With fairly skinny fries, they were done after about 30'. 
Don't overdo the oil. 

## Air fryer version

- dry wedges in air fryer at 120° for 10 m before adding oil
- let cool for a minute and then coat with oil, garlic and herbs
- cook 15 m at 180°
- shake and cook for another 10°

(These are the Philips cooking times for french fries, but then use waxy potatoes, not starchy ones.)
