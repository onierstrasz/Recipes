# Fast-rising Pizza

Four pizzas

- 500 g flour (pizza flour)
- 350 ml H2O
- 13 g salt
- teaspoon sugar
- 100-160 g sourdough yeast discard (60-70% hydration) 

(Normally use pizza flour from Aldi, but white Coop flour works too)

Remove the discard from the fridge.
Let sit in closed jar for 2 hours to reach room temperature.
Open the jar and let the starter double in size for 4 hours.
(Alternatively use frozen yeast, refresh 3x, and then let double in size for 4 hours.)

Add to the yeast the water, flour, salt and sugar. 
Knead (possibly with the machine).
Shape into a ball. Sprinkle some olive oil on top, and put in the fridge for 2-3 hours.
NB: alternatively leave at room temperature (for how long?).

Divide into 4 balls and place on a cooking sheet.
Cover with a tea towel and leave in oven until the dough doubles in size (˜2-4 hours).

Transfer to a cooking tray with a bit of semola. Prepare and cook in oven 15' at 250°.

# How to stretch pizza dough

Flatten by hand. Place on board dusted with semola.
Stretch out from center. Dust and flip. Repeat.

NB: Do this just before taking out the pizza stone/tray from the oven so it stays hot.
