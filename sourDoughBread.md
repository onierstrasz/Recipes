# Pane Casereccio

This is a variant of the "pane di Matera" recipe.

- Sourdough yeast 150 gr
- White flour 150 gr
- Semola flour 350 gr
- Water 350 ml
- Salt 13 gr
- Sugar or honey 1 tablespoon


* Try to add 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate to make fluffier bread.

Hydrolyze the flour (but not the semola) with part of the water taken from the total (of 350 ml) for at least 1 hour.

Also dissolve the salt in some of the water, and set aside.

Mix with the sourdough diluted in the remaining water and sugar, knead well (can use a machine) and then add the diluted salt.

Then make 3 folds every 1/2 hour in the bowl.
Can make the folds below (slap and fold). 

Leave it overnight in the covered bowl room temperature (or in the fridge and in this case in the morning leave it 3 hours out).

NB: Put the dough in a bread basket, covered with a tea towel, to give it shape.

In the morning, transfer the dough to a pastry board (dusted with a bit of flour).
Fold again three times in 30 m intervals.
NB: fold on top, not below. 
Shape it on the baking sheet with a bit of semola.
Let it sit 30 m and then cook.

*Be sure to CUT the top with a sharp knife.*

Place in static oven (not hot air) with a bowl of water in oven at:

- 245° for 12'
- 195° for 24'
- 175° for 12'
- 150° ventilated with draft 10' (use cork)

NB: Can also do all the folds on the second day: knead and let rise all night and in the morning make the folds three every half hour and with the fourth, give the shape and leave on the floured baking sheet for half an hour, then continue as above.

[Tried a smaller loaf with half and half flour and semola
200 g each flour and semola, 120 g yeast, 240 ml water, 10 g salt
but still too heavy.]

* In this recipe for fluffy bread, the dough stays in the fridge for 18 hours, then rises out of the fridge for another 2-3 hours, but without any further folding.

# Open Sourdough bread

This recipe comes from Ian Spampatti on YouTube.
Used it April 3, 2021 and after.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9p74DVxw8A&t=1s

For a 940g loaf (2x 470) you will need:

- 250 g white flour and 250 g Semola. 
- 400 ml water at 25 °
- 80g of doubled liquid mother yeast (or 2g of fresh beer yeast)
- 10g fine salt
- 1 teaspoon honey

Time: 3h + 90' + 1h + 2x45' = 7h + 12-18h + 30' + 30'

NB: Before using the yeast, follow instructions above under refreshing starter.
If it has been in the fridge, you need up to 2 hours closed + 2 hours open till it warms up and at least doubles in size.

Autolysis of 3h with flour, yeast and all the water.
Dissolve yeast in water. 
Add a teaspoon of honey.
Add flour (but not the salt) and absorb into liquid. 
Detach dough from sides of bowl, cover and let sit 3 hrs.
(Put in oven with light on and door open.)
NB: Autolysis is usually without yeast, but this recipe includes the yeast in this process

Add 10 g salt.
Fold back dough from sides for two rotations to mix in salt.
Then knead 2 minutes by beating dough from sides while rotating the bowl.
Or use the kneading machine for 2 minutes,or more. 
Let rise 90 minutes at 25 ° degrees.
NB: Disconnect the kneading machine so it does not overheat?

Knead again 2 minutes.
The dough should become elastic and easily manipulable. If not, knead it some more.
Also add a bit of flour if it is too sticky.
Transfer from kneading machine to lightly oiled, covered bowl.
Let rise 1h at 25 °.

Make the 1st fold. To fold, lift dough and fold sides underneath.
TIP: lightly oil your hands before folding. 
Let rise 45 minutes at 25 °. 

Make the 2nd fold, let rise 45 minutes at 25 °.

Form the loaf.
Turn over loaf in bowl (or on counter) with flour (so the top is now on the bottom) and fold sides inward (on top) to obtain lightly floured loaf.
Form the loaf, folding in all sides, and tucking them together to close it. Cover with flour, taking care to keep flour on the outside.
Wrap in a teacloth covered in flour, so the bottom (closed) part of the loaf is on top. 

Put in the fridge for 12/18 hours.

Transfer the loaf to a sheet of baking paper (or directly to the baking pan, dusted with flour), reversing the loaf so the closed part is at bottom. 
*Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife!*

Oven cooking at 230/240 ° for 30 minutes with lid.
(Cover the bread in the oven with a metal lid or pot for the first 30'.)
Alternative: put oven in humid mode for first 30', and place two oven-proof bowls of water. ext to the loaf. Remove the bowls and switch to regular heat at 180 after first 30'. 

Remove lid and *lower temperature* to 180 °.
Finish cooking for another 30 minutes.

# Panini

Try with ingredients above but end of procedure as described here:

https://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Panini-con-lievito-madre.html

Make 800 g dough for 8 panini as above

- Sourdough yeast 120 gr
- White flour 120 gr
- Semola flour 280 gr
- Water 280 ml
- Salt 10 gr
- Sugar or honey 1 tablespoon
- 1/2 tspn bicarbonate of soda

Prepare dough as above: hydrolyze the white flour with half of the water for 1 hour; dissolve salt in a bit of the water. After an hour dissolve the starter in the water, mix with the flour, semola and honey. Knead in the machine, add the salty water, and continue to knead till "springy". (About 3-minutes kneading.) Fold in a bowl every half hour for three times. Wet hands with water or oil to fold. Cover bowl and let dough rise for 12 hours at room temperature. (To make bread, instead put in a basket in the fridge.)

After the dough has risen for 12 hours at room temperature, divide in two parts.
Fold each above and below twice to reinforce.
Cover and let rest for 30 m.
[I left out this step and directly divided into 8 buns, to let the buns rise for 1 hour covered in the oven before cooking.]
Flatten gently and cut each half into four pieces.
Let rise for 1 h. 
Dust lightly with flour.
Score tops of the buns!

Cook for 40m at 240°. (Too much.)

This recipe says to let rise in oven for 2-3 hours, then cook at 220º for 10-15 m and at 180º for another 15 m.

Tried 220° for 15', 180° for 10' and 150° with oven ajar for 5'.
