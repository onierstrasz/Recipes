# Pane Casereccio

This is a variant of the "pane di Matera"recipe.

Sourdough yeast 150 gr
Semola flour 350 gr
White flour 150 gr
Water 350 ml
Salt 13 gr
Sugar or honey 1 tablespoon

Try a smaller loaf with half and half flour and semola
200 g each flour and semola, 120 g yeast, 240 ml water, 10 g salt

Hydrolyze the flour with a little water taken from the total (of 350 ml) for at least 1 hour, dissolve the salt in a little more water.

* Q Does "the flour" mean semola and white flour together, or just the white flour. If both, it seems too dry!

Dilute the salt in a bit of the water amd set aside. 

Then mix with the sourdough diluted in the remaining water and sugar, knead well (can use a machine) and then add the diluted salt.

Then make 3 folds every 1/2 hour in the bowl and the 4th on the pastry board.
[Can we skip the board and leave the dough in the bowl overnight?]
Can fold below (slap and fold). 

Leave it overnight on the pastry board at room temperature (or in the fridge and in this case in the morning leave it 3 hours out).

[I left it out all night on the board, covered with a bowl and it was fine. Perhaps better in the bowl so it won't overflow. ]

Fold again three times in 30 m intervals.
NB: fold on top, not below. 
Shape it on the baking sheet with a bit of semola.
Let it sit 30 m and then cook.
Be sure to CUT the top. 

Place in static oven (not hot air) with a bowl of water in oven at:

245° for 12'
195° for 24'
175° for 12'
150° ventilated with draft 10' (use cork)

NB: Can also do all the folds on the second day: knead and let rise all night and in the morning make the folds three every half hour and with the fourth, give the shape and leave on the floured baking sheet for half an hour, then continue as above.

# Open Sourdough bread

This recipe comes from Ian Spampatti on YouTube.
Used it April 3, 2021 and after.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9p74DVxw8A&t=1s

For a 940g loaf (2x 470) you will need:

250 g white flour and 250 g Semola. 
400 ml water at 25 °
80g of doubled liquid mother yeast (or 2g of fresh beer yeast)
10g fine salt
1 teaspoon honey

Time: 3h + 90' + 1h + 2x45' = 7h + 12-18h + 30' + 30'

NB: Before using the yeast, follow instructions above under refreshing starter.
If it has been in the fridge, you need up to 2 hours closed + 2 hours open till it warms up and at least doubles in size.

Autolysis of 3h with flour, yeast and all the water.
Dissolve yeast in water. 
Add a teaspoon of honey.
Add flour (but not the salt) and absorb into liquid. 
Detach dough from sides of bowl, cover and let sit 3 hrs.
(Put in oven with light on and door open.)
NB: Autolysis is usually without yeast, but this recipe includes the yeast in this process

Add 10 g salt.
Fold back dough from sides for two rotations to mix in salt.
Then knead 2 minutes by beating dough from sides while rotating the bowl.
Or use the kneading machine for 2 minutes,or more. 
Let rise 90 minutes at 25 ° degrees.
NB: Disconnect the kneading machine so it does not overheat?

Knead again 2 minutes.
The dough should become elastic and easily manipulable. If not, knead it some more.
Also add a bit of flour if it is too sticky.
Transfer from kneading machine to lightly oiled, covered bowl.
Let rise 1h at 25 °.

Make the 1st fold. To fold, lift dough and fold sides underneath.
TIP: lightly oil your hands before folding. 
Let rise 45 minutes at 25 °. 

Make the 2nd fold, let rise 45 minutes at 25 °.

Form the loaf.
Turn over loaf in bowl (or on counter) with flour (so the top is now on the bottom) and fold sides inward (on top) to obtain lightly floured loaf.
Form the loaf, folding in all sides, and tucking them together to close it. Cover with flour, taking care to keep flour on the outside.
Wrap in a teacloth covered in flour, so the bottom (closed) part of the loaf is on top. 

Put in the fridge for 12/18 hours.

Transfer the loaf to a sheet of baking paper (or directly to the baking pan, dusted with flour), reversing the loaf so the closed part is at bottom. 
*Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife!*

Oven cooking at 230/240 ° for 30 minutes with lid.
(Cover the bread in the oven with a metal lid or pot for the first 30'.)
Alternative: put oven in humid mode for first 30', and place two oven-proof bowls of water. ext to the loaf. Remove the bowls and switch to regular heat at 180 after first 30'. 

Remove lid and LOWER TEMPERATURE to 180 °.
Finish cooking for another 30 minutes.
