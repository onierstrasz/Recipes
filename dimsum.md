# Dim Sum Terminology

Here is a list of Dim Sum terms that I have collected from various sources (books, friends & restaurant menus). Dim Sum are Chinese breakfast or lunch items that are a cross between pastries and appetizers (except they are the whole meal). Often Chinese restaurants will serve Dim Sum on weekends, starting early in the morning, and finishing in the early afternoon.
Most of these words can be spelled in an unending variety of surprising ways. The most useful terms to know are (described below): 
- *Har*, *Char Siu*, *Guy (Gai)*, *Ngau (Guk)*, *Wu*, *Bao (Bow)*, *Cheung Fun*, *Gok* and *Gow*.

Popular items include: *Har Gow*, *Har Cheung Fun*, *Fun Gok*, *Wor Tip*, *Guy Bow*, *Char Siu Bow*, *Siu Mai*, *Jar Har Fat* and, of course, *Spring Rolls*.
Dim Sum are generally served 3 or 4 to a plate. I find I can eat about 6 to 10 Dim Sum, depending on how hungry I am, so count on 2 to 3 items per person. It’s nice to be initiated by someone in the know, but if you don’t have anyone available, be brave. There are often English translation menus available, but they may not be as descriptive as you’d like. Often Dim Sum are not ordered from a menu at all, but are brought around on little carts. You pick whatever looks interesting and the cart moves on. (Ask what it’s called so you’ll remember next time.)
