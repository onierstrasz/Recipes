# Hasselback Potatoes

- baking potatoes (starchy)
- butter
- garlic, herbs (rosemary, oregano, thyme ...)

- skewer the potatoes with a wooden or metal needle
- slice the potatoes halfway at 3mm intervals (the skewer will stop you cutting all the way through)
- remove the skewers
- preheat the oven to 200° C (or 180° with hot air)
- chop the garlic and herbs
- melt the butter and mix in the garlic and herbs
- pour over the potatoes (well into the slices)
- cook for ~ 1 hour until golden & tender

Optional: add melted cheese
NB: plan for at least 1 hour cooking time, possibly more
you can keep the potatoes warm
