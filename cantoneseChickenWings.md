# Cantonese Chicken Wings

## Ingredients

- 32 chicken wings
- 1 (~ 100g) ginger root
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 tablespoons honey (liquid)
- 1 tablespoon chinese 5-spice powder
- 2 tablespoons soya sauce
- 1 tablespoon hoinsin sauce
- salt, pepper.

## Preparation

Serves 4. Preparation: 20-25 minutes. Marination: 30 minutes. Cooking: 9-10 minutes. Calories per portion: 155.

- Rinse and dry the chicken wings.
- Clean the ginger and chop finely.
- Clean and press the garlic cloves.

## Cooking

- Take the chopped ginger root, garlic, honey, spices, MSG (yech!), soya sauce and hoinsin sauce, mix well and bring to a boil in a large frying pan. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper. 
- Add the chicken wings to the hot marinade, mix well, turning occasionally.
- Let the chicken wings cool on an oven rack over a piece of aluminum foil (to catch the dripping sauce).
- Pre-heat the oven to 220°. 
- Place the oven rack with the chicken wings in the top of the oven. 
- Cook for 9-10 minutes, watching carefully. 
- Remove the chicken wings as soon as they are brown and crispy.
- Place the chicken wings on a pre-heated (!) platter and serve immediately. 
- Eat 'em up, yum!

## Suggestions

Many Chinese cookbooks recommend that spices like salt, pepper and the 5-spice powder be slowly heated in a dry pan. (This will heighten the flavour.)
If you can't get ahold of chicken wings, substitute the lower half of chicken legs, or chop a small chicken into 8 pieces.
